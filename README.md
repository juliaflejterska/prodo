PRODO is a React application that is used to <b> monitor your productivity </b> so that you can improve your performance as much as possible and become <b> the best </b> version of yourself.

---

It includes three main components:

âœ¨ <b> Calendar, </b> that allows you to <b> add your own events </b> in two ways: by submitting the form or by clicking the space on the calendar and dragging your mouse down (just like in Google Calendar). Later, you can also delete them by clicking on them and confirming;

âœ¨ <b> Expense Tracker, </b> where you can <b> add your income and expenses </b> to have full control over your spending. It shows your current account balance, the history of your transactions (which you can sort alphabetically or in ascending/descending order) and also creates a chart displaying this data;

âœ¨ <b> Goals Tracker, </b> where you can <b> add your goals </b> and then edit and delete them as well. You can choose from four available categories and then display your goals by them.

---

After logging in, in Home Page, there's also a component that <b> generates a random quote fetched from an API. </b>

<b> All data is saved in LocalStorage </b> so as not to lose it after refreshing the page or turning off your device.

---

PRODO allows you to <b> create your own account and and log in using Google Firebase Authentication. </b>

For testing purpose (if you don't want to sign up), you can use:
